Memes have become an inseparable part of internet culture. Every day, we see funny images and captions on social media that make us laugh or reflect reality in a humorous way. 
But have you ever wondered about the <strong>history of memes and their spread across the internet</strong>? This article will give you the full story from the origins of memes to 2025.

<h2>What Is a Meme and Why the Name?</h2>
<p>
The term "meme" was coined by biologist <strong>Richard Dawkins</strong> in 1976 in his book "The Selfish Gene," referring to the idea that culture spreads between people similarly to genes. 
On the internet, the term came to represent funny images, jokes, and satirical drawings—a fast way to share humor and everyday situations.

Soon after, funny cat images known as <em>LOLcats</em> became popular, marking the start of the meme phenomenon as we know it today.
